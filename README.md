  ## Installation
  Clone the respository from the repo in GitHub. Make sure you install Node.js and NPM on your computer. You will need to install the node package manager (NPM) using ```npm init``` and then the inquirer module using ```npm i inquirer```.

  ## Usage
  Run ```node index.js``` in the command line and answer the questions about your project. After all the prompts are answered, a new "README.md" will be created in the current working directory.


  You will need:
  >1. Your project title
  >2. A short description of your project explaining the what, why and how. Use the following questions as a guide:
        > - What was your motivation?
        > - Why did you build this project?
        > - What problem does it solve?
  >3. Installation - include any steps required to install your project.
  >4. Usage - provide instructions and examples for use. You can include screenshots or a screen recording.
  >5. Credits - if you have any collaborators, third-party assets that require attribution, or tutorials you followed, list them and include the links.
  >6. License - this lets other developers know what they can or cannot do with your project. You can select one from the list.
  >7. Features - if your project has a lot of features, include them here.
  >8. Contributing - if you would like other developers to contribute to your project, include the guidelines for how to do so here.
 > 9. Tests - if you have any tests for your application, provide examples of how to run them here.
