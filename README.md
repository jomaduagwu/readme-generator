# Professional README Generator

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)


## Description
  This application was created to quickly and easily generate a professional README.md file, based on a series of questions a user answers in the command line using the inquirer package. This would allow a project creator to devote more time to work on their project.

  Run ```node index.js``` in the command line and answer the questions about your project. After all the prompts are answered, a new "README.md" will be created in the current working directory.


  You will need:
1. Your project title
2. A short description of your project explaining the what, why and how. Use the following questions as a guide:
    - What was your motivation?
    - Why did you build this project?
    - What problem does it solve?
3. Installation - include any steps required to install your project.
4. Usage - provide instructions and examples for use. You can include screenshots or a screen recording.
5. Credits - if you have any collaborators, third-party assets that require attribution, or tutorials you followed, list them and include the links.
6. License - this lets other developers know what they can or cannot do with your project. You can select one from the list.
7. Features - if your project has a lot of features, include them here.
8. Contributing - if you would like other developers to contribute to your project, include the guidelines for how to do so here.
9. Tests - if you have any tests for your application, provide examples of how to run them here.
